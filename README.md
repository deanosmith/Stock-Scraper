# Stock-Scraper
A python based web-scraping script that pulls various stock prices from different Google searches and connects to the Google Sheets API to:
- Compare the prices to yesterday, with a simple console output of the value differences
- Stores today's data for comparison tomorrow.

And then sends a Google Chat message to, hopefully, start my morning off with a smile...
