# Stock-Scraper
A python based web-scraping script that pulls various stock prices from different Google searches and connects to the Google Sheets API to:
- Compare the price to yesterday, with a simple output of the value differences
- Stores today's data for comparison tomorrow.

and then send a slack message to, hopefully, start my morning of with a smile...
